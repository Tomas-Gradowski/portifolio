# Tomas Portfolio

A clean, organized hub for my personal projects (electronics & software) and study materials (course notes).  
This repository powers a public site built with **MkDocs** so classmates can browse and I can showcase my work.



## Structure
- `docs/` → website content (MkDocs).
  
  - `projects/` → electronics & software.
  - `notes/` → course notes and study resources.
  - `assets/` → images and shared media.
  
  

## Licensing
- **Code**: MIT (see `LICENSE`).
- **Notes/Docs**: CC BY-NC 4.0 (see `LICENSE-NOTES.md`). Do **not** upload copyrighted books or scans; only your own notes/solutions.

## Academic Integrity
This repo includes my **own** explanations meant for learning.  
Please follow your course's collaboration & plagiarism rules.
